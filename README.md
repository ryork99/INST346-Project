# Monitoring Network via Pi - Raspberry Pi 

## This project will be completed by May 2020
* This repository is intended to be used in completing a group project in INST 346: User-Centered Design.
* The University of Maryland (UMD) has recently started using Eduroam as its main wireless network on campus. It is a secure, world-wide roaming internet access service that provides wireless connectivity when visiting participating institutions. 
* However, UMD students, faculty/staff still experience connectivity problems as they complain that the network is spotty,  which prevents a successful connection. 
* Walls, interference, and weak access points prevent Eduroam from being accessible everywhere. 
* Our group decided to build a Wi-Fi scanner that will allow us to easily locate dead spots where Eduroam has poor signal quality. 
* The information problem that we are trying to solve is connectivity problems to eduroam on campus and we will build a Wifi scanner, dead spots detector, for UMD students, faculty, and staff. 
* This Wi-Fi scanner will make use of several different types of hardware, namely a Raspberry Pi. 
* We will directly connect this System on Chip (SOC) to a battery and possibly an antenna. 
* These will be connected in a way that the dead spot detector is ergonomic enough to be carried around by users for them to search for dead spots. 
* Software is necessary in order for the hardware elements to interact with the network. We will need to use software and write code in order to program the Raspberry Pi SoC to interact with the antenna in the manner we require it to.
* We will also need software elements in order to facilitate a useful way to display the information. We will create a program that will display all of the relevant diagnostic information of the Wi-Fi signal. 
* Ideally, the Wi-Fi scanner will show channel, signal quality, MAC address, maximum download and upload speed, average download, upload speed, and encryption. 
* It will check the co-channel interference and recommend the best channel to the user. * It will also generate a graphical display of signal levels over time for the user to monitor the Wi-Fi. We will also design a summary report format and make it easier to collect the results exported by the scanner.
## Equipment needed for turning Raspberry Pi into a Network Scanner:
* Raspberry Pi
* At least an 8GB (up to 32GB) or Micro SD * Card if using a Raspberry Pi 2, 3 or B+
* Small LCD Screen for the Rasberry Pi
* Battery Pack (to power both Pi and Screen)
* USB Keyboard and Mouse 
* HDMI Cable
* Ethernet Cord or Wifi dongle
* Bluetooth Adapter (Only if not using a Pi 3 or Zero W)
* A button to turn on the Pi an automatically start our software
* A 3D printed case to hold all the components
